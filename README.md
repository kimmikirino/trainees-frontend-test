This project is a Front end code challenge proposed by Jaqueline and Par√° from Sciensa.

# Overview

The challenge was to build a reactjs app that connects to my own Github API and list all public repositories from my user.

# Main page

The Main page contains the base infomation about my Github like:
  - login;
  - number of followers;
  - number of people I follow;
  - number of repositories;
  - type of my account.

Next to Repos, there is a link to list all my repositories 

# On the link

The link is opened in a diferent path where all my repositories name and description are shown separeted by a line.
