# Front end code challenge

Hello :D

Thanks for your interest in joining the team :)
This is a front end code challenge designed to assess the ability of a trainee candidate to create an app using our current technology stack.

We wish you the best of luck!

Thanks,
Sciensa Front end developers (Jaqueline & Rodrigo Par√°)

## Overview 

Your challenge is to build a reactjs app that connects to the Github API (https://developer.github.com/v3/) and list all public repositories from your user, if you don't have any repository, select another user.

Example: https://api.github.com/users/kimmikirino/repos
The route above shows all repositories of kimmikirino user.

https://api.github.com/users/kimmikirino
Shows details about kimmikirino user.
