# Front end code challenge

Hello :D

Thanks for your interest in joining the team :)
This is a front end code challenge designed to assess the ability of a trainee candidate to create an app using our current technology stack.

We wish you the best of luck!

Thanks,
Sciensa Front end developers (Jaqueline & Rodrigo Par√°)

## Overview 

Your challenge is to build a reactjs app that connects to the Github API (https://developer.github.com/v3/) and list all public repositories from your user, if you don't have any repository, select another user.

Example: https://api.github.com/users/kimmikirino/repos
The route above shows all repositories of kimmikirino user.

https://api.github.com/users/kimmikirino
Shows details about kimmikirino user.

## Rules

- Create your own UI/UX design, but responsive;
- Use some features of ES6+;
- Use HTML5 tags;

## Feel free to

- Use create-react-app;
- Use any additional library;

- Create a search field to filter the commits by the term inserted into the field;
- Show us your work through your commit history;
- Host the website on the service of your choice;
- Use some state managing solution;
- Hooks

## Evaluation criteria
